# Orbis: A Modular Physics Simulation Engine

Orbis is an easily extendable skeleton for physical simulation

The demo file is called "orbis_demo.scm" in the "orbis" directory. The "orbis-engine" library can be found in the "sdf" directory. This library contains 2 files that are different from the SDF-provided code. Those 2 files are "world.scm" and "objects.scm". 


A written report is also included explaining the project in detail.
